<h1>NBZ</h1>

The NBZ was launched to provide a framework to automate web browsers to scrap or test any web page, based on selenium webdriver. This provides the user a higher level layer and a simpler way to create web testing scripts. Also, browsermob-proxy is implemented as proxy into NBZ to capture http requests.

NBZ is configured with nbz scripts.

IMPORTANT: Whenever you want to test into your own browser how a web page behaves to code your script, you must do it into incognito mode. Each script session is executed as if it were incognito mode, a totally new instance of the browser, cache, cookies, local storage and session storage.
